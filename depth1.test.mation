## Basics

### Markdown

Mation enables styled documentation for configuration files. Lines between markdown denoted start and end tags will be syntax highlighted in supported editors.
Markdown documentation sections can appear anywhere except in-between a key-value definition.

Start tag is
/** <case insensitive 'md'|'note'> **

End tag is the standard C-style block-comment end tag '*' follow immediately by '/'.

### Keys

Keys can be unquoted as long as they do not contain spaces and start with legal literal characters of a..z|A..Z|0..9|'$'|'_'|'@'|
Non-starting characters can contain other legal literal characters after the first character, which includes '-'|

Duplicate keys are allowed. But API can be (later) configured to catch and throw error on duplicate keys within the same level.

### Values 

### Key Value Pairs 
Commas are required after each but last pair, which can be inserted or omitted.
*/

a: 1,        // unquoted key
a: 2,        // duplicate key
"akey": 2,   // double quotes
'key2': 2,   // single quotes
'"k"' : 2,   // double within single quotes
"'k'" : 2,   // single within double quotes
"\"k" : 2,   // use escape character '\x' will appear vebatem as is
try-to: do,  // dashed literal key
or: do-this, // dashed literal value

## Data Structures

### Arrays and Lists

Arrays are denoted with '( ... )' and will support only values of the same type.
Lists are denoted with '[ ... ]' and its values do not need to be of the same type.

If you are you working with a target language such as JavaScript, it makes no difference which is used since it does not differenciate the tow.
For other languages where there is a difference, if there is a target parser for it, it will generate the correct output. 
The JSON output may add this type information, should the need arise.

### Commands
*/

do: (         // Use "(" to enforce array structure
  move 1 2 // No "," needed between non-keyvalue arguments
  move 1 2, 3 -4 // For readability, commas can be inserted between arguments.
    // Commas don't change the way it is parsed.
    // This is good for calling functions whose signature is
    // Eg. f(x0, y0, x1, y1), and you like the call to be more readable
  move [1,2] [3,-4] // To pass list of lists
  move [1 2] [3 -4] // Same
  move (1,2) (3,-4) // Same, if you prefer "()"s for coordinates
  move (1 2) (3 -4) // Same
  turn { x:1, y:2 } // One key-values map
  turn x:1 y:2      // Multi-signle key-values 
)
